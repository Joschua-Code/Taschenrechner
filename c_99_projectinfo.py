#Goals and maybe goals
#Giving every button his function
    #Implementing the history button
        #Making a list function that saves every result
#Implementing the Keyboard to insert Numbers or Operators
#Making the buttons having more height
#Buttons adjusting to and filling the window
#Style
    #Making the background fancier if possible - slightly grey and blueish? - see throu would be optimal
    #Making the buttons fancy - brighter colour than background
    #If possible making the frame of the program dark and transparent and the name of the program in the center
#If changeing the operator after already having calculated - removing the result and equal sign
#When pressing equal again making the result the new number 1 and removing the rest
# Making the numbers slightly brighter than the other buttons and the equal button light blue or something
# Solving the problem of divididing by zero






#Known Bugs
#Not possible to have several zeros behind the comma (need to convert the value into a string to solve)
#Numbers have 0 behind the comma even tho they dont have a fractional value
